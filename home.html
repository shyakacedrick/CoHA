            <h1>Lets stay our hygiene clean, not cleanliness</h1>
            <p>The term cleanliness should not be used in place of hygiene. Cleaning in many cases is removing dirt, wastes or unwanted things from the surface of objects using detergents and necessary equipment. Hygiene practice focuses on the prevention of diseases through the use of cleaning as one of several inputs. For example, a janitor cleans the floor of a health centre using detergent, mop and broom. They might also use chlorine solution to disinfect the floor. The cleaning process in this example is the removal of visible dirt, while the use of chlorine solution removes the invisible microorganisms. Hygienic practice encompasses both cleaning for the removal of physically observable matters and the use of chlorine for the removal of microorganisms. The hygiene practice in this example aims at preventing the spread of disease-causing organisms. Cleaning is a means to achieve this task.</p>

                        The exercise of proper personal hygiene is one of the essential parts of our daily life. Many people in rural areas may not understand what good or bad personal hygiene is. The prevention of communicable diseases, like diarrhoea, trachoma and many others is highly possible through the application of proper personal hygiene. You need to learn the proper practice of personal hygiene and use this for the prevention and control of important public health diseases that are prevalent in your locality.

                <h1>How we work</h1>
                <p> We do offer free trainings about hygiene and sanitation, especially to the rural communities.
                    We focus more on how everyone must keep their environment and one's self clean and health by avoiding messy communities
                    which cause illiness and to any living thing around them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So far, we have interviewed the refugees in Kakuma Refugee Camp individually and turns out approximately 70% of the refugee communities
                    have experianced heavy diseases due to unclean sorroundings
                    As we were helping these communities, the number dropped to 40% of the infected lives after we have trained them the benefits of
                    keeping their hyhiene and sanitation very firm.
                    
                </p>
                <p>
                    Apart from Kakuma camp in Kenya, in 2019 we also Provided a bundle of trainings to other eastern Africa parts like 
                    Uganda, Burundi and Somalia. Our aim was to reduce the spread of Covid-19 by spreading awareness of how it effects people 
                    and how to prevent themselves as prevention is better than cure.
